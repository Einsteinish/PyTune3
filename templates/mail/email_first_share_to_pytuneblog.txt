{% block body %}Your shared story is now on your pytuneblog

You can view your pytuneblog here: {{ pytuneblog_url }}

Your pytuneblog also has an RSS feed: {{ pytuneblog_rss }}

{% if shared_stories > 1 %}You've already shared {{ shared_stories }} stories, but you may not have known that your shared stories are on your pytuneblog.{% else %}You just shared your first story on PyTune. All of your shared stories are available on your pytuneblog.{% endif %}

This is a personal website made for you that you can customize. You can also share out links to your pytuneblog, where friends and followers can reply and re-share your stories.

pytuneblogs were built so you would have a way to share stories with people who aren't on PyTune and don't want to load the entire reader just to read and comment on your shared stories.{% endblock body %}
